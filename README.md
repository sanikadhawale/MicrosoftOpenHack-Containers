# MicrosoftOpenHack-Containers
Learnings from Microsoft OpenHack : Containers - A Challenge Based Training.

Had a hands-on on various Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), Azure Virtual Machine, Azure Container Registry (ACR), Azure Networking, Azure Key Vault and tools like Docker, Azure CLI, kubectl.
Worked with the projects provided by OpenHack team - web side: tripviewer, api side: poi, userprofile, user-java, trips. Worked on building the docker files of the projects, pushing them to AKS, creating connectivity between them and deploying the end to end project.
